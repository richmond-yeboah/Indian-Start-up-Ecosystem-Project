# Indian-Start-up-Ecosystem-Project

## Project Overview

My team is looking to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem and so I, as a data expert has been tasked with investigating this start-up ecosystem in India, to recommend the best course of action for the team. My research is going to focus on the details of funding for these start-ups in India, where I will dive deep into a data containing all the details about fundings received by the start-ups and communicate my findings and recommendations to the team in the best way possible.

## Data Sources

For this project, I had to gather data from different sources. The data for 2018 is hosted in a github repository [here](https://github.com/Azubi-Africa/Career_Accelerator_LP1-Data_Analysis/blob/main/startup_funding2018.csv)
